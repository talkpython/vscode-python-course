Most of the materials for this chapter are provided within this folder. However, for the videos titled "Linting and Formatting Code", "Refactoring Code with VS Code", and "Code Snippets" in this chapter refer to the materials/code found in the [06-running-and-debugging folder](../06-running-and-debugging/). Use VS Code to open that folder so that you may try what's shown in the video.
